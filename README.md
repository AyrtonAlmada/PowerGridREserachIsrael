# Real-Time Stochastic Assessment of Dynamic N-1 Grid Contingencies

This repository contains a collection of Julia implementations for simulating and analyzing power grid dynamics under transmission line faults. The framework is designed to study the transient behavior of power systems, including the evolution of generator phase angles and frequency deviations following disturbances such as line outages.

The code implements both analytical solutions of linearized swing dynamics and stochastic simulations, allowing researchers to investigate how faults propagate through the network and how long transmission lines operate beyond their thermal limits.

The toolkit was developed as part of research on grid stability, cascading failures, and overheating risk in transmission networks.

## Overview

Power transmission networks are modeled as weighted graphs where nodes represent buses (generators or loads) and edges represent transmission lines. The dynamic behavior of the system is described using the classical swing equation, which captures the interaction between generator inertia, damping, and network coupling.

The repository provides tools for:

* Constructing the network Laplacian from transmission data

* Building mass and system matrices of the swing equation

* Bomputing analytical time-domain solutions during fault events

* Performing stochastic simulations of grid dynamics

* Evaluating overheating indicators for transmission lines

* Detecting constraint violations and fault propagation

* Conducting Monte-Carlo experiments to estimate system risk

These tools enable the study of transient stability and thermal stress in power grids following line failures.

## Key Features

### Network Modeling

* Construction of the weighted Laplacian matrix representing the transmission grid topology.

* Support for generator parameters including inertia, damping, and power injections.

### Dynamic Simulation

Two types of simulations are available:

#### Analytical simulation

* Closed-form solution of the linearized swing dynamics.

* Efficient evaluation of trajectories during fault and post-fault phases.

#### Stochastic simulation

* Euler–Maruyama integration of stochastic swing dynamics.

* Random perturbations representing load fluctuations or renewable variability.

### Fault Modeling

The framework models line faults and clearance events using a three-stage timeline:

```
t < T1      : normal operation
T1 ≤ t ≤ T2 : faulted network topology
t > T2      : post-fault recovery
```

The transmission network is modified during the fault interval to represent the removal or degradation of a line.

### Overheating Indicators

The repository implements metrics that quantify thermal stress in transmission lines by measuring the time during which phase differences exceed safe limits.

These indicators provide a proxy for line overheating risk and are useful for studying cascading failures.

### Monte-Carlo Analysis

Random fault scenarios can be generated to estimate the distribution of overheating indicators and identify vulnerable lines in the network.
